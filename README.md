###### Web dev by day, Swift trainee by night

# Hey! 👋🏼 I'm Victor


I'm a dedicated and passionate **Frontend Developer** in the ever-evolving world of web development. 
I'm thrilled to share a brief overview of my **journey**, **skills**, and some of my favorite **projects** with you.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on my personal portfolio
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and reviewing concepts on JS and FE in general, check out [My Personal Learning Curve](https://www.notion.so/My-Personal-Learning-Curve-f9608061c90945e881b7e96ba8303ac4?pvs=4)

I'm always **learning new things** and making sure I'm **up to date** on the latest tech and design trends so 
I can incorporate them into my work.

I really appreciate you taking the time to get to know me and my journey in frontend development. 
If you want to work with me, work on a project together, or just talk about web development, just shoot
me an [email](mailto:victor.hernandezn@outlook.com) or send me a message on
